  <h1>Be Mobile First</h1>
  <p>Most Google users now access the search engine from a mobile device, so it makes sense for Googlebot to crawl and index pages primarily using the smartphone agent. This change will have a significant impact on your SEO strategy, so it's important to be aware of and prepared for mobile-first indexing. <img src="https://cdn2.clickdesigns.com/users/1375/custom_image/85316/final.png" width="250px" height="250px" class="img-right" alt="mobilelayouts"></p>
<!--Added my image-->

  <p>Mobile-first indexing means that Google will predominantly use the mobile version of your content when indexing and ranking your pages. This is a shift from the historical norm, where the index primarily used the desktop version of a page's content. </p>

    <h2>Tips To Ensure Mobile-First Indexing</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Use responsive design/Mobile-first design</li>
    <li>Structure your content</li>

  <h3>Nurturing Customer Relationships is Key to Marketing Success</h3>
  <p>Acquiring new customers is essential for businesses to grow, but it is also important to keep the customers you have. In fact, studies show that it costs <strong>five</strong> times more to attract a new customer than it does to keep an existing one. This is where customer <em>ENGAGEMENT</em> and customer relationship marketing come in. By nurturing your relationships with current and potential customers, you can create lifelong advocates for your brand who will help drive growth.</p>

  <p><q>Engaged customers are loyal customers.</q> In fact, engaged customers are three times more likely than disengaged customers to say they would recommend a company's products or services to others. When you nurture your relationship with a customer, they become invested in your success and feel closer to your brand. This leads them to not only stay loyal themselves, but also act as ambassadors who promote your business to their friends and families. If you take these words to heart, you will be fine.</p>

  <p>Here is a quote from CareerFoundry's website:</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/15-inspirational-ux-design-quotes-that-every-designer-should-read/">
    A product is only ever as good as its UX. You can have the most innovative technology, but if it isnâ€™t user-friendly, it will struggle to reach mainstream adoption. Products like the iPod and the iPhone would never have become so popular based on the technology alone; what really sealed the deal is the fact that they have great UX.
